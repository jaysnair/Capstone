## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Load the data to R
```{r}
library(readr)
shooting_data <- read_csv("D:/datasets/police-KBP-2013-14-15-FULL-DFE.csv")
```

Look at the data and understand the attributes
```{r}
head(shooting_data)
tail(shooting_data)
str(shooting_data)
```

Check the missing values of the "Cause of Death", "State", "Gender", "age", "Race", "Was the deceased armed?" and "Did the deceased have priors?" attributes. 
```{r}
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Cause of Death`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`Cause of Death`)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`State`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`State`)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Gender`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`Gender`)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Age`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`Age`)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$Race) == T)
length(shooting_data$Race)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`)
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`) == TRUE)
length(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`)
```

Replace "Gender" attribute missing value with "Male"
```{r}
str(shooting_data$Gender)
table(shooting_data$Gender, useNA = "always")
shooting_data$Gender<-replace(shooting_data$Gender,shooting_data$Gender == "", NA)
shooting_data$Gender[which(is.na(shooting_data$Gender))] = 'Male'
sum(is.na(shooting_data$Gender))
```

Replase "Age" attribute missing values with mean age.
```{r}
str(shooting_data$Age)
mean.age<- mean(shooting_data$Age[!is.na(shooting_data$Age)])

mean.age <- round(mean.age, digits = 0)
mean.age
shooting_data$Age[is.na(shooting_data$Age)] = mean.age
sum(is.na(shooting_data$Age))
```

Replace "Race" attribute missing value with "Unknown"
```{r}
str(shooting_data$Race)
table(shooting_data$Race, useNA = "always")
shooting_data$Race<-replace(shooting_data$Race,shooting_data$Race == "", NA)
shooting_data$Race[which(is.na(shooting_data$Race))] = 'Unknown'
sum(is.na(shooting_data$Race))
```

Replace "Was the deceased armed?" attribute missing value with "Unknown".
```{r}
str(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`)
table(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`, useNA = "always")
shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`<-replace(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`,shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?` == "", NA)
shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`[which(is.na(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`))] = 'Unknown'
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Was the deceased armed?`))
```

Replace "Did the deceased have priors?" attribute missing value with "Unclear".
```{r}
str(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`)
table(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`, useNA = "always")
shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`<-replace(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`,shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?` == "", NA)
shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`[which(is.na(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`))] = 'Unknown'
sum(is.na(shooting_data$`Did the deceased have priors?`))
```

Remove unwanted attributes
```{r}
testdata <- shooting_data[c("Cause of Death", "Race", "Was the deceased armed?", "Did the deceased have priors?")]
str(testdata)
```

Visualization of key attributes
```{r}
hist(shooting_data$Age, breaks = 20)
#barplot(shooting_data$Age, density = 100)
barplot(prop.table(table(shooting_data$Race)), las=2)
```
